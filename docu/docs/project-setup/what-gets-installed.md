# What Gets Installed

When you use `claude-code-templates` to set up your project, it installs several core files and configurations to integrate Claude Code effectively into your development environment.

## Core Files

-   **`CLAUDE.md`**: This is the main configuration file for Claude Code, containing language-specific best practices and instructions.
-   **`.claude/settings.json`**: This file stores automation hooks and general Claude Code settings.
-   **`.claude/commands/`**: This directory contains custom commands tailored for common development tasks within your project.
-   **`.mcp.json`**: This file holds Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations, extending Claude Code's capabilities.
